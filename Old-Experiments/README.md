A collection of my programming projects in C and Java, including advanced game development.
A collection of my programming projects in C and Java, demonstrating my skills in game development, logical thinking, and problem-solving.
Projects
Advanced Game Development Projects (Java, C)
Description: This project includes the development of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe and SOS games. I first built a basic console-based version in C to establish the core logic and then later translated and enhanced the projects by building them with a Graphical User Interface (GUI) in Java.
Problem-Solving: The Tic-Tac-Toe game was developed with two distinct computer opponent algorithms, showcasing my ability to iterate on a project and tackle increasingly complex problems.
Algorithm 1: A simple heuristic-based AI that focuses on blocking the player and making moves to win.
Algorithm 2: A more advanced AI that uses a strategic approach to guarantee a win or a tie, demonstrating a deeper understanding of game theory.
Technologies Used: C, Java, Java AWT/Applets.
Dots and Boxes Game (Java)
Description: A two-player game with a user-friendly graphical interface. The game logic was developed to accurately track the game's state, identify when boxes are completed, and update the score in real-time.
Key Skills: This project demonstrates my skills in logical problem-solving, GUI development, and event-driven programming.
Technologies Used: Java, Java AWT/GUI.
How to Run the Code
To run these projects, you will need to have a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
