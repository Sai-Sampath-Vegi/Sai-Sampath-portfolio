# Portfolio: Modern Refactored Projects

> **Note:** This repository is the result of a complete refactor of my earlier projects. While the core game mechanics remain the same, the code has been updated to follow **industrial standards, clean code principles, and optimized architecture.**

## Technical Improvements
In this version, I have improved upon the legacy logic by implementing:
* **Code Readability:** Professional naming conventions and self-documenting code.
* **Refined Logic:** Optimized the transitions between C, Java Console, and Java GUI.
* **Industrial Standards:** Modularized logic and improved organization of event-driven components.

## Featured Projects

### 1. Advanced Game Development (C, Java, HTML)
* **Tic-Tac-Toe and SOS:** Multi-platform implementations including **C Console**, **Java Console**, **Java GUI**, and **HTML** for web compatibility.
* **Heuristic Blocking AI:** Optimized logic for immediate threat detection and move prioritization.
* **Strategic Game Theory AI:** A robust algorithm designed for optimal play and move efficiency.

### 2. Dots and Boxes Game (Java)
A high-performance two-player GUI game focusing on precise state management and real-time score calculation, refactored for better event-handling performance.

## Conclusion
Refactoring these projects was a significant milestone in my journey toward becoming a professional developer. It allowed me to apply industrial standards to complex logic and improve the overall user experience through better software architecture. I am committed to continuous learning and applying these clean code principles to all my future work.
